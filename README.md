# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe (Java)

## Description
This was a project I did whilst doing the Java For Beginners track through JetBrains Academy.
Each stage was completed using the topics that were discussed in each stage. 
The end product is a simple tic-tac-toe game.

### How to play:
The board is printed and you enter the coordinates of where you would like to place your first 'X'.
The coordinates are organized where the row is entered first, then a space and then the column.
Since the board is 3 x 3, your coordinate numbers will be 1, 2 or 3 for the row and for the column.
It will announce who the winner is when someone has won.
It will only announce when the whole board is filled (whether someone won or it was a draw) or when there is an immediate winner.

## Learning outcomes
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using methods, handling errors, and processing user input.

## About
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

## What you'll do and what you'll learn:
### Stage 1/5:
To start things off, the program needs to be able to print any state of the field. You’ll write a serious multi-line program using a lot of prints.
### Stage 2/5:
Now it’s time to analyze user input and print the state of the field depending on it. You’ll learn to address specific positions in a string to achieve the required outcome.
### Stage 3/5:
Now we’re going to write a fully-functioning multi-line program that responds to the user’s actions and analyzes the state of the field. Not only will it tell you who is winning, but it will also determine if the situation on a given field is theoretically possible!
### Stage 4/5:
Tic-tac-toe is not all about analysis – a game is meant to be played! Write a program that can change the state of the field, as your first real step toward a fully-functioning game application!
### Stage 5/5:
Finally! Thanks to this app, you can always challenge a friend to play a quick game of Tic-Tac-Toe!
